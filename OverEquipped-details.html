        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          OverEquipped is a thrilling online tabletop card game, which can also be played in person, that puts players in the shoes of heavily-armed warriors. With three decks to choose from, including an armor, weapon, and an OP deck filled with incredibly powerful equipment, players must strategize and equip up to 5 pieces of equipment to defeat their opponents. Featuring unique descriptions and illustrations with every card, as well as attack and defense scores and durability, players must continuously adapt and swap out their gear as they battle to be the last one standing. 
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay & Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          OverEquipped is a 2 player character building card game that I developed during the peak of the pandemic using playingcards.io which allows friends to play it virtually or even physically through printing out each card. Players take turns drawing from a weapon and armor deck and have 5 slots to equip their character with various items. Each card has a certain amount of durability, so players must be prepared to equip new weapons and armor as the game progresses. The game is won by the player who takes their opponent's health down to 0. All of the cards in OverEquipped have unique effects and some are part of a set that can have a powerful effect when all pieces are equipped.    
        </p>
        <p>
          The designs for OverEquipped were created in Adobe Photoshop. 

          The mechanics of the game simulates a battle between two warriors who have way too much equipment on, with players taking turns to draw from either a weapon or armor deck and equipping those cards onto their character. At the end of each turn, players attack their opponent and the equipment each player currently has loses durability with each hit until they break and are replaced with another piece of equipment. The competitive nature of the game requires players to think strategically in order to choose the most optimal cards for their character to outlast their opponent.
