        <h2>
        Summary
        </h2>
        <p>
          World on Fire is a firefighting game developed in Unity that features a 2-axis wraparound level. The game includes procedural fire-spreading and smoke-spreading mechanics, as well as plenty of refuel stations which the player will rely on. The player uses their extinguishers to put out these fires in hopes of saving the town, the game ends when there are no more refuel stations.
        </p>
       

        <h2>
        Gameplay & Mechanics
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main goal of World on Fire is for the player to extinguish as many fires as possible using their fire extinguishers, which they can recharge at refuel stations throughout the level. If the fires burn the refuel stations, the player loses. The game features procedural fire-spreading and smoke-spreading mechanics, which keeps the gameplay challenging and requires the player to constantly be on their toes as they navigate the level. The player earns points based on how many fires they are able to put out, adding an element of competition and replayability to the game. The game features 3D assets created in Blender, including procedurally generated buildings, foliage, and vending machines that make each map unique. As the player travels through the edge of the map, they experience a seamless transition which leads them to emerge from a different section of the map.

          Role Breakdown
          </h2>
          <i><p><b>Contributions</b>: Game Managing code, Player Controller, Game Sfx, Game BGM, UI System, Foliage & Vending Machine Assets</p></i>
          <p>
            One of my main responsibilities was creating the background music, sound effects, and menu UI, which all help set the atmosphere and enhance the gameplay experience. I also helped develop the gameplay code, player controller, and seamless transition, allowing the player to experience a smooth and immersive journey through the game's unique and procedurally generated levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I was responsible for creating the foliage assets for the game, which helped create an immersive firefighting experience. As the player travels through the edge of the map, they experience a seamless transition that leads them to emerge from a different section of the map similar to the bonus levels from Sonic Mania. This feature adds an element of surprise and also allows players to travel to various areas of the map without having to run through large bodies of fire.
