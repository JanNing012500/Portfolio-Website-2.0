        <h2>Summary & Features</h2>
        <p>
        Raveball Arena is a futuristic, rhythm-based soccer game featuring dynamic events and procedurally changing arenas.
          
        Players can dribble the ball by colliding with it and use a shooting bar mechanism to pass and shoot. The game features procedural level interactions, including musical events that cause the arena to shapeshift, spawn items, and change layouts or gamemodes. Players can also pick up items that spawn randomly, affecting their abilities, and interact with the ball and other players using their gun. 

        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is an event-based game, the music in Raveball Arena plays a major role in the gameplay loop, with the arena and other aspects of the game changing based on the music's energy and different phases, such as the beginning, buildup, drop, and breakdown. There are clear indications in the music when events are about to happen, and these events can have a major impact on the gameplay, such as walls rising to split from the ground. Passes and shots in the game are determined by a power bar where timing determines the launch speed. There are also random events, powerups, and obstacles that help keep the game exciting. The team that scores the most goals in a given round wins.
       </p>
       
       
<h2>Role Breakdown</h2>
<p>
  As a part of my senior capstone project, I initiated the development of a prototype with a colleague during winter break. By building Unreal Engine 5 from source before its official release date, we were able to create a prototype that we <i><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSQFYjOWSDch4BEVQI6IDYY6N1EWTTmEma2X-8PFNp8/edit?usp=sharing"target="_blank">presented to our professors and classmates</a></i>. This presentation led to the successful recruitment of additional team members for 3D assets and sound design. 

</p>



<p>
As the project manager, I utilized Azure DevOps for version control and sprint planning, holding weekly meetings to ensure that all team members were on track with their assigned tasks. 

I also served as the UI/UX programmer, where I was responsible for designing and implementing the main menu and HUD. I collaborated closely with programmers to ensure proper implementation of widget classes.  

I was responsible for creating and researching various systems, including the crosshair UI, movement and animation systems, and conducted several playtests and made changes based on the feedback received.

Additionally, I debugged various features such as dynamic ability cooldown, health bar issues, and ball glitches and created a heads-up display for both 2 player and 4 player modes, including the scoreboard, event panels, and skills.
