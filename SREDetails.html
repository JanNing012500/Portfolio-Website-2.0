        <font size="+1"><p>
        Walmart's Site Reliability Engineer team faces the challenge of not being able to quickly access relevant data as well as view MTTD, MTTE, and MTTR information in 1 location as they’re currently scattered across different systems. This fragmentation of data hinders efficient identification and resolution of issues. To overcome this challenge, I designed a centralized hub that provides a single point of access to all relevant information

          <h2>Solution</h2>   
          <font size="+1"><p>
          My solution utilizes Figma to create a centralized hub that displays crucial information in one place. The hub is designed with SREs in mind, ensuring easy navigation and understanding of the information.   
          <br><br>
          The hub features 6 panels designed to provide a better user experience by displaying the information in an organized and visually appealing manner. Each panel will contain charts, graphs, and tables to display key data points, such as the number of incidents, average time to detect incidents, and average time to resolve incidents. Additionally, the hub will be customizable, allowing SREs to configure the panels as per their requirements.

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>   
          
          <font size="+1"><p>
          The primary goal is to create a centralized hub that makes it more convenient for the team to effectively identify the source of each incident. The hub will provide SREs at Walmart with easy access to all incidents with a visualized tree as well as MTTD, MTTE, and MTTR graphs that lead to the respective applications. The final design will provide a clear and concise overview of essential statistics for anomaly detection and incident response. The use of a dark professional color scheme and font style is more suited for SREs as uninterrupted hours of staring at a monitor will strain their eyes.

        <h2>Process</h2>


        <font size="+1"><p>
        In order to gain a thorough understanding of the needs of the SRE team, I met with Shreenidhi, a Site Reliability Engineer at Walmart. Shreenidhi explained the various technical aspects of their process when it comes to locating and resolving incidents and described the various factors that unnecessarily complicated this process. 
        <br>
        As he showed me some of the current software they use, I began to understand how confusing and complicated it was to identify the source of the incident. This process can seem like a never-ending maze in a large-scale system such as Walmart due to the complexity of the codebase and interdependence of various components. 
        This process is time-consuming, mentally taxing, and prone to human error, leading to extended downtimes and lost revenue for the company which this project aims to resolve.
        <br>
        If every SRE had a map that led them straight to the source of the incident, this would significantly speed up this process. Instead of encountering a bunch of dead ends, they would effortlessly walk straight into the center of the maze. [maybe make and insert a picture of a maze and map]
        <br>
        This design revolves around transforming each component into a node. Each node is color-coded based on their status and mapped out onto a tree which depicts every node, allowing SREs to easily navigate through the tree.
        <br>
        I chose to place each node onto a tree as each tree has several branches that are all connected, which I felt most accurately represented the task at hand. Since branching is commonly used in software management and development to depict, this would be a very familiar concept to the SRE team. 
        </p></font>

      <h2>Design Principals</h2>
      <font size="+1"><p>
        Users first(?)[make a graphic comparing dark vs light mode]:
        To address the challenge of eye strain caused by long hours of working on a computer screen, a color palette consisting mainly of darker colors and brighter colored accent colors was chosen. The darker colors serve as a background that reduces eye strain, while the accent colors help important information stand out. 
        <br>
        Color choice / 60/30/10 (accent colors):
        Green, yellow, and red were selected to represent the statuses of each node on the timelines, which map out each incident. These specific colors were chosen as they’re commonly associated with traffic signals. The use of these colors help users to quickly identify, locate, and resolve incidents, on top of being able to report incidents quickly by selecting the appropriate color, rather than having to read the status options in text form.
        <br>
        Easy-to-digest dense information:
        The large graphs featured in each panel provide users with a quick overview of critical data. The data on each graph is color-coded, which enhances the experience of interpreting the data. Color-coding reduces cognitive load and allows users to understand the information faster and with more ease. Additionally, the graph's size and placement in each panel provides a visual hierarchy, ensuring that the most critical data is easily accessible and prominent.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>   
    
    <font size="+1"><p>
      To help Walmart's SRE team efficiently identify and resolve incidents, I designed this centralized hub that provides easy access to all relevant incident data in one place. The hub features 6 panels with trees that map out key data points. The design improves the efficiency and accuracy of incident resolution of the SRE team.

      Overall, my solution aims to transform the incident resolution process from a never-ending maze to an effortless walk, providing a clear and concise overview of essential statistics for anomaly detection and incident response.
