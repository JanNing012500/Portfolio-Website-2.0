Additionally, the hub will be customizable, allowing SREs to configure the panels as per their requirements.

        <h2>Process</h2>


        <font size="+1"><p>
        In order to gain a thorough understanding of the needs of the SRE team, I met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreenidhisudhakar/"target="_blank">Shreenidhi</a>, a Site Reliability Engineer at Walmart.<br> Shreenidhi explained the technical aspects of their process when it came to locating and resolving incidents along with the various factors that <b>unnecessarily complicated this process.</b> 
        <br><br>
        As he showed me some of the current software they use, I began to understand how confusing and complicated it was to identify the source of the incident. This process can seem like a <b>never-ending maze</b> in a large-scale system such as Walmart due to the complexity of the codebase and interdependence of various components. This process is <b>time-consuming, mentally taxing, and lacks clarity</b> which this project aims to resolve. 
        <br><br>
        <a><img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/2aB7ZjZ.png" width="1000" height="730"/></a>  
        <br><br>
        If every SRE had <b>a map that led them straight to the source of the incident</b>, this would significantly speed up this process. Instead of encountering a bunch of dead ends, they would <i>effortlessly walk straight into the center of the maze.</i> 
                <br><br>
        This design revolves around transforming each component into a node. Each node is <b>color-coded based on their status</b> and mapped out onto a tree which depicts every node, allowing SREs to easily navigate through the tree.
        <br><br>
        I chose to place each node onto a tree as each tree has several branches that are all connected, which I felt most accurately represented the task at hand. Since branching is commonly used in software management and development, this would be a very <b>familiar concept</b> to the SRE team.         </p></font>

        <br><br>
        To address the challenge of <b>eye strain</b> caused by long hours of working on a computer screen, a color palette consisting mainly of <b>darker colors</b> and <b>brighter accent colors</b> was selected. The accent colors help important information stand out over the dark background.   
        <br><br>
        <h4>Color choice - 60/30/10 (accent colors):</h4>

        Green, yellow, and red were selected to represent the statuses of each node on the trees.

        The large graphs featured in each panel provides users with a quick overview of critical data. The data is also color-coded, which enhances the experience of interpreting the data. Color-coding <b>reduces cognitive load</b> and allows users to understand the information <i>faster and with more ease.</i> Additionally, the graphs’ size and placement provides a <b>visual hierarchy</b>, ensuring that the most <i>critical data is easily accessible</i> and prominent.
