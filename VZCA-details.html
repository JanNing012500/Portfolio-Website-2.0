        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          In Vegan Zombie Crop Apocalypse, players take on the role of a farmer fighting to protect their crops and feed their wife during a vegan zombie apocalypse. The main goal of the game is to harvest crops from the field and bring them home quickly in a bucket to feed your wife and keep her alive. However, the vegan zombies spawn in waves and they have an insatiable appetite for vegetables and will stop at nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players must defend their crops by using their shotgun to shoot the onslaught of vegan zombies. As players harvest their crops, they must quickly harvest and fill up their bucket, as the wife's hunger bar depletes quickly. Pumpkins and cabbages are the most filling and will fill up the hunger bar more quickly, making it crucial for players to defend these plants from zombies. Once a vegetable has matured and the player leaves them alone for too long, they will despawn, so it's also important to load the bucket up with as many vegetables as possible before heading back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players need to make strategic decisions about when to defend their crops and when to harvest them, balancing their priorities to keep their wife alive. This game offers a unique twist on the zombie genre, with the added challenge of defending their crops while preventing their wife’s hunger bar from reaching zero. The gameplay is intense, fast-paced, and requires players to be constantly on the move, defending the crops, and harvesting as much food as they can, while trying to outsmart the relentless vegan zombies.
        </p>
       
       
<h2>Role Breakdown</h2>
<p>
  I played a key role in the <a href="https://imgur.com/5SVEjxP"target="_blank">conceptualization of the game</a> as well as the design and implementation of the user interface, including the main menu with a walking zombie animation and fade effects between menu transitions. I also created the wife's hunger bar system, the crosshair, along with the overall mechanics of the game. I helped set up animation blueprints, create the gore system, lighting, and also worked with voice actors to record our character voice lines. <br><br><i><b>As we continue development, I will add all additional HUD, shop, scoreboard, menu features and assist with gameplay blueprints.</b></i>
</p>





<h2>Further development</h2>
<p>
  Vegan Zombie Crop Apocalypse was created as a part of the <b>Ludum Dare 52 Game Jam</b>. The theme for this Game Jam was Harvest, which had a 72-hour deadline. The game received positive feedback from players, which encouraged us to continue its development. We are currently working on enhancing the game's features and polishing its overall gameplay, with the goal of releasing it on Steam as a fully finished product.
</p>
<b><font size="+1"><p>1/11/23 Development Update:</p></font></b>
<p>
Since the Game Jam’s conclusion, we have implemented several updates such as a deadeye effect, an intuitive ammo and clip system and UI including ammo pickups, ammo hover effects (bobbing and rotating), bucket QOL flip, and improved SFX. We are currently working on improving additional aspects of the game such as adding a tooltip for the grabbing mechanics, re-adjusting hitboxes, implementing day/night cycle, scoring system, zombie hoard system, and player-spawnable crops.

<b><font size="+1"><p>1/15/23 Development Update:</p></font></b>
<p>
  -Added settings menu with functional graphical changes<br>
  -Adjusted zombie hitboxes <br>
  -Added zombie health system <i>(100 Health)</i><br>
  -Shotgun damage range calculations (100 dmg at 0 range, dmg drop-off for over 50ft)<br>
  <small><i>damage = 100 * (1 - (distance / 50))^2 if distance <= 50 <br>
  damage = 5 if distance > 50 <br>
  This formula uses the player's distance from the zombies to calculate the damage dealt, with the maximum damage of 100 being dealt at a distance of 0 feet, and the minimum damage of 5 being dealt at a distance of 50 feet or greater. The damage dealt decreases smoothly as the distance between the player and the zombies increases, following a parabolic curve.
