        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Raveball Arena is a futuristic, rhythm-based soccer game featuring dynamic events and procedurally changing arenas. As a member of the development team, I implemented and researched various systems, including UI, movement, and animation, and contributed to debugging and main menu creation. I also worked on the implementation of heads-up displays and the local multiplayer system, and participated in playtesting and implementing changes based on feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the project manager for my Senior Capstone Project, I led a team in the development of a competitive third-person shooter soccer game called Raveball Arena. I utilized Azure DevOps for version control and sprint planning, holding weekly meetings to ensure that all team members were on track with their assigned tasks. Additionally, I was responsible for the complete game UI and HUD, as well as contributing to gameplay programming.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before the official release of Unreal Engine 5, we successfully built it from source and created a basic prototype of our game during our winter break. We <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSQFYjOWSDch4BEVQI6IDYY6N1EWTTmEma2X-8PFNp8/edit?usp=sharing"target="_blank">presented the prototype</a> to professors and classmates, successfully recruiting additional team members for 3D assets and sound design.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay Features</h2>
        <p>
          The game features procedural level interactions, including musical events that cause the arena to shapeshift, spawn items, and change layouts or gamemodes. Players can pick up items that spawn randomly, affecting their abilities, and interact with the ball and each other using their weapons. The music in Raveball Arena plays a major role in the gameplay loop, with the arena and other aspects of the game changing based on the music's energy and different phases, such as the beginning, buildup, drop, and breakdown. There are clear indications in the music when events are going to happen, and these events can have a major impact on the gameplay, such as walls rising to split the field into parts. Passes and shots in the game are determined by a power bar where timing matters, and there are also random events, powerups, and obstacles that can change up the gameplay during each round, which lasts as long as the music does. The team that scores the most goals in a given round wins.


As a member of the Raveball Arena development team, I was responsible for implementing and researching various systems, including the dynamic crosshair UI, movement and animation systems, and Lyra UI systems and game modes. I also worked on migrating into and exporting from Lyra, and debugging various features such as player menu stuck bugs, health bar issues, and ball glitches. In addition, I created the main menu of the game, adding gameplay options and sound effects for menu buttons, as well as effects that highlight button pressing. I also created blendspaces for animations and imported them to the character model. My responsibilities also included contributing to the implementation of heads-up displays for both 2 player and 4 player modes, including the scoreboard, event panels, and skills, as well as working on the local multiplayer system and dynamic ability cooldown. Our team conducted multiple playtests and implemented changes based on feedback received during these sessions.
