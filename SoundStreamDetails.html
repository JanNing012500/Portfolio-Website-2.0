            Inspired by the issues faced by users on Sony's website, my design addresses the pain points of hard-to-locate warranty information, distracting model serial numbers, and an unoptimized user reviews section. 
            By implementing a vibrant yet harmonized blue/purple/magenta color palette, simplifying the layout, and prioritizing essential information, this project aims to enhance the user’s shopping experience.</p>
            <h2>Role</h2><p>As the sole contributor of this project, I took on the responsibility of designing the entire UI/UX project, from conducting user research to implementing the final design choices.</p>

        <p>The ultimate goal of this project is to <b><i>enable users to quickly and easily find the information they need</i></b> and make informed decisions when selecting their preferred wireless headphones. Through the use of a harmonized <span style="color: #0558f3">blue</span>/<span style="color: #650cca">purple</span>/<span style="color: #f305b8">magenta</span> color palette, a simplified layout, and a focus on essential information, this design seeks to create a visually engaging and efficient shopping experience.</p>

        <h1>Design Direction</h1>   
        
        <p>During my research of similar brands' websites for headphones, I found that important information was often difficult to find, and the use of a plain white color theme resulting in an unmemorable and generic shopping experience. 
          To address these issues, I decided to implement a more vibrant color palette and include animations that help the most important aspects of each page stand out. 
          The overall design direction of this project was to create a visually engaging and user-friendly shopping experience that prioritizes essential information.

        <p>Both mobile and desktop low-fidelity wireframes were created using Figma, mapping out the essentials of each page. From there, I focused on creating a <br>high-fidelity mockup for mobile and  iterated and improved various aspects of every single page to optimize the user’s shopping experience. </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Constraints</h2>   
        
        <p>
        Throughout this project, I faced various challenges as this was my first time using Figma to design a UI/UX project. To overcome these challenges, I conducted extensive research and completed online courses to ensure that I could effectively utilize Figma to its full potential. Despite the learning curve, I was able to create a visually appealing design that helped solve the issues identified in the research phase, leading to positive feedback from the user survey.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to researching and learning how to use Figma effectively, I also experimented with various design styles and created numerous assets and animations to find the ones that worked best for this project. This process allowed me to refine the design and ensure that it was not only visually appealing but also functional and intuitive for the user.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>   
        
        <p>Through user research, I discovered various issues with Sony's website for wireless headphones, such as the difficulty in finding warranty information, distracting model numbers in the product titles, and a plain white color scheme that made buttons difficult to locate. Additionally, the existing questions and answers section was poorly designed, and the review section lacked personalization, with blank profile icons instead of photos of users wearing the product.</p>
        <p>To address these problems, I designed a colorful and harmonized UI/UX project that incorporated blur and drop shadow effects to draw attention to important elements. I also created an FAQ section with answers to commonly asked questions, which improved the customer experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout this project, I faced challenges with my limited experience in Figma and had to experiment with different design styles and assets to find the best solutions. Ultimately, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in UX/UI design and how to effectively communicate with users. The resulting design will have a positive impact on the user's shopping and browsing experience, making it easier to find essential information and feel confident in their purchase decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final product achieves the main objective of improving the overall user experience in terms of being able to easily locate crucial information, browse common answers to questions they may have, and easily checkout their item(s) without having to jump through the hoops of having to create an account. The fun graphics, color palette, and font choice are just the cherries on top in terms of boosting brand consistency.
