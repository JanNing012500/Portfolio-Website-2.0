        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Raveball Arena is a futuristic, rhythm-based soccer game featuring dynamic events and procedurally changing arenas. As a member of the development team, I implemented and researched various systems, including UI, movement, and animation, and contributed to debugging and main menu creation. I also worked on the implementation of heads-up displays and the local multiplayer system, and participated in playtesting and implementing changes based on feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          Successfully building UE5 from source, a basic prototype of our game was created before the official release during winter break. We <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSQFYjOWSDch4BEVQI6IDYY6N1EWTTmEma2X-8PFNp8/edit?usp=sharing"target="_blank">presented the prototype</a> to professors and classmates, successfully recruiting additional team members for 3D assets and sound design. As the project manager for my Senior Capstone Project, I led a team in the development of a competitive third-person shooter soccer game called Raveball Arena. I utilized Azure DevOps for version control and sprint planning, holding weekly meetings to ensure that all team members were on track with their assigned tasks. Additionally, I was responsible for the complete game UI and HUD, as well as contributing to gameplay programming.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Role details</h2>
        <p>
        
          As a member of the Raveball Arena development team, I was responsible for implementing and researching various systems, including the dynamic crosshair UI, movement and animation systems, and Lyra UI systems and game modes. I also migrated into and exported from Lyra, and debugged various features such as player menu stuck bugs, health bar issues, and ball glitches. In addition, I designed the main menu of the game, adding gameplay options and both visual and sound effects for all the menu buttons. I also created blendspaces for animations and imported them to the character model. In order to allow players to have the option of playing multiplayer mode with their friends, I implemented a heads-up display for both 2 player and 4 player modes, including the scoreboard, event panels, and skills, and also worked on the local multiplayer system and dynamic ability cooldown. Several playtests were also conducted by me and we implemented changes based on feedback received during these sessions.
