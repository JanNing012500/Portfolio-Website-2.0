        Walmart's Site Reliability Engineer team faces the challenge of not being able to quickly access relevant data as well as view MTTD, MTTE, and MTTR information in 1 location as theyâ€™re currently scattered across different systems.

          <br><br>
          The hub features 6 panels designed to provide a better user experience by <b>displaying the information in an organized and visually appealing manner.</b> Each panel will contain charts, graphs, and tables to display key data points, such as the number of incidents, average time to detect incidents, and average time to resolve incidents. Additionally, the hub will be customizable, allowing SREs to configure the panels as per their requirements.

        <h2>Process</h2>


        <font size="+1"><p>
        In order to gain a thorough understanding of the needs of the SRE team, I met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreenidhisudhakar/"target="_blank">Shreenidhi</a>, a Site Reliability Engineer at Walmart.<br> Shreenidhi explained the technical aspects of their process when it came to locating and resolving incidents along with the various factors that <b>unnecessarily complicated this process.</b> 
        <br><br>
        As he showed me some of the current software they use, I began to understand how confusing and complicated it was to identify the source of the incident. This process can seem like a <b>never-ending maze</b> in a large-scale system such as Walmart due to the complexity of the codebase and interdependence of various components. This process is <b>time-consuming, mentally taxing, and lacks clarity</b> which this project aims to resolve. 
        <br><br>
        <a><img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/2aB7ZjZ.png" width="1000" height="730"/></a>  
        <br><br>
        If every SRE had <b>a map that led them straight to the source of the incident</b>, this would significantly speed up this process. Instead of encountering a bunch of dead ends, they would <i>effortlessly walk straight into the center of the maze.</i> 
                <br><br>
        This design revolves around transforming each component into a node. Each node is <b>color-coded based on their status</b> and mapped out onto a tree which depicts every node, allowing SREs to easily navigate through the tree.
        <br><br>
        I chose to place each node onto a tree as each tree has several branches that are all connected, which I felt most accurately represented the task at hand. Since branching is commonly used in software management and development, this would be a very <b>familiar concept</b> to the SRE team.         </p></font>

        To address the challenge of <b>eye strain</b> caused by long hours of working on a computer screen, a color palette consisting mainly of <b>darker colors</b> and <b>brighter accent colors</b> was selected. The accent colors help important information stand out over the dark background.

        Green, yellow, and red were selected to represent the statuses of each node on the trees.

        The large graphs featured in each panel provides users with a quick overview of critical data. The data is also color-coded, which enhances the experience of interpreting the data. Color-coding <b>reduces cognitive load</b> and allows users to understand the information <i>faster and with more ease.</i> Additionally, the graphsâ€™ size and placement provides a <b>visual hierarchy</b>, ensuring that the most <i>critical data is easily accessible</i> and prominent.
